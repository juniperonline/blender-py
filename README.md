### Overview 

Using this tool, you can preview and pick your favourite combinations of three-part outfits inside Blender. Afterwards, a model will be exported in the format of your choice.

### Naming the outfit 

To name your outfit, write your desired text in the first input cell.

### Picking the combination

In the drop-down menus named **Top Style**, **Bottom Style** and **Footwear Style**, you can find all the possible outfit pieces, named by style. 
The **Compose Outfit** button will preview your choice in the viewport.

### Randomizing
You can generate a random outift using the **Generate Random** button. 

### Export format 
Once happy with the combination, you can pick an export format and press the **Export Outfit button**. This action will create a 3D file in your working directory.
